Instagram Style Post Feed

This project is a small Instagram-style feed created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The goal of this project is to dynamically render multiple posts on the page using JavaScript, instead of hard-coding the HTML each time.

All post details (name, username, avatar, image, comment, likes, etc.) are stored inside a JavaScript array.
JavaScript loops through this array and displays each post on the webpage.
